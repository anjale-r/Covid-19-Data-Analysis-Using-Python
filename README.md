# Covid-19 Data Avalysis Using Python
### Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate key measures and prepare them for analysis. We will work with the COVID-19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which contains daily cumulative confirmed cases per country. Additionally, we will use a Happiness dataset that includes various life factors, scored by people living in each country worldwide. By merging these two datasets, we aim to explore potential relationships between the spread of COVID-19 and overall happiness levels in different countries.

### Key Learning Outcomes

Understand the purpose of the analysis and the datasets involved.

Import and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset (published by John Hopkins University).

Aggregate and clean data by dropping irrelevant columns and preparing meaningful measures.

Merge COVID-19 data with the Happiness dataset to analyze potential relationships.

Perform correlation analysis and visualize insights using Seaborn.
