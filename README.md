# Covid-19 Data Avalysis Using Python
### Project Overview

This project helps to learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate key measures and prepare them for analysis. The data used includes the COVID-19 dataset, published by Johns Hopkins University, which contains daily cumulative confirmed cases per country. Additionally, the Happiness dataset includes various life factors scored by people living in different countries worldwide. By merging these two datasets, we aim to explore potential relationships between the spread of COVID-19 and overall happiness levels across countries.

### Key Learning Outcomes

Understand the purpose of the analysis and the datasets involved.

Import and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset (published by John Hopkins University).

Aggregate and clean data by dropping irrelevant columns and preparing meaningful measures.

Merge COVID-19 data with the Happiness dataset to analyze potential relationships.

Perform correlation analysis and visualize insights using Seaborn.
